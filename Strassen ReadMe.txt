The strassen.py script  takes input/output files directly from the user and runs either strassen or ordinary matrix multiplication. It also includes a matrix size check and multiplication counts. 



To run the script:

1. Go to script and click run
2. The user will be prompted to "Enter Integer Input". This is the size of the matrix, and here we can input an integer such as 2, 4, or 8.
3. Then the user will be prompted to "Enter Multiplication Type". Here the choices are either to type in "Strassen" to perform strassen multiplication or "Ordinary" to perform ordinary multiplication
4. After this, the user will be required to "Enter the name of input file". This is self explanatory as the user can enter their desired input, for example I would type "Input1.txt"
5. Finally the user will be required to "Enter the name of output file". This is self explanatory as the user can enter their desired output for example I would type "Output1.txt"


Two Examples:

#Running Ordinary Function

Enter Integer Input: 2
Enter Multiplication Type: Ordinary
Enter the name of input file: Input1.txt
Enter the name of output file: Ordinary1.txt

#Running Strassen Function

Enter Integer Input: 2
Enter Multiplication Type: Strassen
Enter the name of input file: Input1.txt
Enter the name of output file: Strassen1.txt
