# Algorithm-Projects
Implementation of commonly used methods in computer science algorithms including matrix multiplication, hashing, and string matching. Each script handles I/O arguments.

The Strassen script utilizes ordinary and strassen multiplication commonly used in linear algebra matrix mathematics.

The hashing script contains custom hashing schemes and collision handling methods.

The LCS string matching script contains a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the Longest Common Subsequence problem.
